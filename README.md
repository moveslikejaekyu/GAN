# GAN
What i studied with Generative Adversarial Network

### 1. What is GAN?
     -> Neural Network model that Ian Goodfellow introduced in 2014
     -> Most interesting idea in the last ten years in Machine Learning (by Yann LeCun Facebook AI Director))
     -> Adversarial Learning with generator and discriminator
     
</br>

### 2. Concept of GAN

  - We should focus on the full name of "GAN" </br>
  - "Generative" "Adversarial" Networks </br>

  - The Discriminator learns using traditional supervised learning techniques(Usally Deep-learning), classifying inputs into two classes(real or fake)    </br>
    
  - The Generator learns is trained to fool the discriminator </br>
  

 With this basic concept, author used a metaphor for trying to understand Generator and Discriminator easily. </br>

 - The discriminator can be thought as a police who should discriminate real or fake money  </br>
 - The Generator can be thougt as a counterfeiter who want to make fake money as real and even police confused to discriminate it! </br>
 
So, how to make fake money as real? </br>
Generator(Conterfeiter) should learn to create samples that are drawn from the same distribution as the traing data  </br>

</br>

### 3. Model Explanation and Actual flows in codes

  - This chapter are explained kindly in uploaded Slides. So look it up please!
